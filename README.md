Weather API App Sample
Beyond of just applying my development skill, the purpose of this application is getting API request dynamically using Android geolocalization background services, and in the future the user can search using a name of a city and getting a real time weather response of it.

This is just a API request sample app where we receive responses from CurrentWeatherData API from openweathermap.org
